	  	<dt><span><span>What’s the Catch?</span></span></dt>
	  	<dd>There is no catch.  Our ZBATE REBATE program simply utilizes an existing real estate industry referral standard to put money into your pocket.</dd>
	</div>
 
 	<div class = "questionWrapper">
  		<dt><span>How does the program work?</span></dt>
  		<dd>Participating agents will, upon closing of your transaction collect a commission.  Part of the commission is sent to ZBATE as a referral.  The money is processed and then a check is sent to you!</dd>
  	</div>
 
 	<div class = "questionWrapper">
	  <dt><span>What must happen for me to qualify for my ZBATE REBATE?</span></dt>
	  <dd><p>The following items must be completed for you to get your rebate.</p>
		  <ol>
		  	<li>You must register</li>
		  	<li>Your agent must register</li>
		  	<li>You and your agent must sign the ZBATE REBATE referral form</li>
		  	<li>Your agent must submit both the referral fee and the ZBATE REBATE CLOSING FORM to us</li>
		  </ol>
	  </dd>
	</div>

	<div class = "questionWrapper">
  		<dt><span>How soon will I get my rebate check?</span></dt>
  		<dd>After the closing of your purchase or sale the agent you used will send a referral fee to ZBATE.  After the funds clear we will process and mail your check.  This averages 14-24 days after your sale closes.</dd>
  	</div>

  	<div class = "questionWrapper">
  		<dt><span>Can I use my own agent?</span></dt>
  		<dd>Sure!  In fact we encourage all of our members to interview and hire any agent they are comfortable with.  Simply enter your agent’s information when you sign up!</dd>
  	</div>

	<div class = "questionWrapper">
  		<dt><span>Can you recommend an agent?</span></dt>
  		<dd>After the closing of your purchase or sale the agent you used will send a referral fee to ZBATE.  After the funds clear we will process and mail your check.  This averages 14-24 days after your sale closes.</dd>
  	</div>

	<div class = "questionWrapper">
  		<dt><span>What if I’m already working with an agent?</span></dt>
  		<dd>As a Zbate member you can ask your existing agent if they would participate in our rebate program, however, our system is primarily designed to assist you before you begin your home buying or selling process.</dd>
  	</div>

  	<div class = "questionWrapper">
		<dt><span>What if my home is already listed or I am in contract to purchase a home?</span></dt>
		<dd>Zbate is a licensed Realtor owned business and honors the Realtors Code of Ethics and therefore does not want to violate either their code of ethics or professional standards and in no way wants to interfere with an existing contractual relationship.Of course you can ask your agent to participate but ZBATE does not recommend it.</dd>
	</div>
  
  <div class = "questionWrapper">
		<dt><span>What if the agent I want to use, but have not hired yet refuses to participate?</span></dt>
		<dd><p>Well, you have 2 choices</p>
		<ol>
	  		<li>Hire the agent you want and our ZBATE REBATE will not apply</li>
	  		<li>Interview other agents who are willing to participate in the ZBATE REBATE Program.</li>
		</ol>
  		</dd>

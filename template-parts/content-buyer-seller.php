    <h1>Get Your ZBATE REBATE!</h1>

	<p>It's simple, just register and we will match you with a participating real estate agent, or you can choose your own.  Participating agents send a portion of their commission to ZBATE.  It's that easy!</p>

	<p>After the closing on your home, your agent will send us a referral fee and we will process your "ZBATE REBATE".</p>

	<p>Closing costs are soaring...don't you deserve a break today!</p>
